              <h4>EXERCISING ACCESS, DATA PORTABILITY, AND DELETION RIGHTS</h4>
              <p>
                To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights
                described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to
                us by sending us a message on our website. Only you, or a person
                registered with the California Secretary of State that you
                authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer
                request related to your Personal Information. You may also make
                a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.
              </p>
              <p>
                You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or
                data portability twice within 12 months. The verifiable consumer
                request must:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably
                  verify you are the person about whom we collected Personal
                  Information or an authorized representative.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to
                  properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal
                Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to
                make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to
                you.
              </p>
              <p>
                We will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable
                consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority
                to make the request. Response Timing and Format
              </p>
              <p>
                We try to respond to a verifiable consumer request within
                forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time, we
                will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.
              </p>
              <p>
                We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically,
                at your option. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the
                12 months preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt.
                The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot
                comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability
                requests, we will select a format to provide your Personal
                Information that is readily useable and should allow you to
                transmit the information from one entity to another entity
                without hindrance, specifically by electronic mail
                communication.
              </p>
              <p>
                We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable
                consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or
                manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants
                a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide
                you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
              </p>
              <h4>OPT-OUT AND OPT-IN RIGHTS</h4>
              <p>
                If you are 16 years of age or older, you have the right to
                direct us to not sell your Personal Information at any time (the
                “right to opt-out”). We do not sell the Personal Information of
                consumers if less than 16 years of age unless we receive
                affirmative authorization (the “right to opt-in”) from either
                the consumer who is between 13 and 16 years of age or the parent
                or guardian of a consumer less than 13 years of age. Consumers
                who opt-in to Personal Information sales may opt-out of future
                sales at any time.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can exercise the right to opt-out, you (or your authorized
                representative) may submit a request to us at email:
                 Info@boominance.com.
              </p>
              <p>
                We will only use Personal Information provided in an opt-out
                request to review and comply with the request.
              </p>

              <h4>NON-DISCRIMINATION</h4>
              <p>
                We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your
                CCPA rights. However, note that many features of our website,
                our products, or our services will not function without your
                Personal Information. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Deny you goods or services.</li>
                <li>
                  Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services,
                  including through granting discounts or other benefits, or
                  imposing penalties.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for
                  goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or
                  services.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted
                by the CCPA that can result in different prices, rates, or
                quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer
                will reasonably relate to your Personal Information’s value and
                contain written terms that describe the program’s material
                aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires
                your prior opt-in consent, which you may revoke at any time.

                Personal Information from our records, unless an exception

              <p>
                We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information

              <h4>EXERCISING ACCESS, DATA PORTABILITY, AND DELETION RIGHTS</h4>
              <p>
                To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights
                described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to
                us by sending us a message on our website. Only you, or a person
                registered with the California Secretary of State that you
                authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer
                request related to your Personal Information. You may also make
                a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.
              </p>
              <p>
                You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or
                data portability twice within 12 months. The verifiable consumer
                request must:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably
                  verify you are the person about whom we collected Personal
                  Information or an authorized representative.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to
                  properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal
                Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to
                make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to
                you.
              </p>
              <p>
                We will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable
                consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority
                to make the request.
              </p>

              <p>Response Timing and Format</p>
              <p>
                We try to respond to a verifiable consumer request within
                forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time, we
                will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.
              </p>
              <p>
                We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically,
                at your option. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the
                12 months preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt.
                The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot
                comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability
                requests, we will select a format to provide your Personal
                Information that is readily useable and should allow you to
                transmit the information from one entity to another entity
                without hindrance, specifically by electronic mail communication
              </p>
              <p>
                We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable
                consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or
                manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants
                a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide
                you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
              </p>

              <h4>OPT-OUT AND OPT-IN RIGHTS</h4>
              <p>
                If you are 16 years of age or older, you have the right to
                direct us to not sell your Personal Information at any time (the
                “right to opt-out”). We do not sell the Personal Information of
                consumers if less than 16 years of age unless we receive
                affirmative authorization (the “right to opt-in”) from either
                the consumer who is between 13 and 16 years of age or the parent
                or guardian of a consumer less than 13 years of age. Consumers
                who opt-in to Personal Information sales may opt-out of future
                sales at any time.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can exercise the right to opt-out, you (or your authorized
                representative) may submit a request to us at email:
                 Info@boominance.com.
              </p>
              <p>
                We will only use Personal Information provided in an opt-out
                request to review and comply with the request.
              </p>

              <h4>NON-DISCRIMINATION</h4>
              <p>
                We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your
                CCPA rights. However, note that many features of our website,
                our products, or our services will not function without your
                Personal Information. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>Deny you goods or services.</li>
                <li>
                  Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services,
                  including through granting discounts or other benefits, or
                  imposing penalties.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for
                  goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or
                  services.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted
                by the CCPA that can result in different prices, rates, or
                quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer
                will reasonably relate to your Personal Information’s value and
                contain written terms that describe the program’s material
                aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires
                your prior opt-in consent, which you may revoke at any time.
              </p>

              <p>
                California’s “Shine the Light” law (Civil Code Section §

                certain information regarding our disclosure of Personal
                Information to third parties for their direct marketing
                purposes. To make such a request, please send us an electronic
                message through our website or write us at our email address
